                    My goal was to learn about the state of artificial intelligence -- where we're further along than people realize and where we're still a long ways off. These challenges always lead me to learn more than we expected, and this one also gave me a better sense of all the internal technology Facebook engineers get to use, as well as a thorough overview of home automation. So far this year, We are focussed on building a simple AI that I can talk to on my phone and computer, that can control homes, including lights, temperature, appliances, teachingkids, music and security, that learns tastes and patterns, that can learn new words and concepts, and that can even educate people and lives. It uses several artificial intelligence techniques, including natural language processing, speech recognition, face recognition, and reinforcement learning, written in Python, PHP and Objective C. In this MISSION, We'll explain what we have built and what we learned along the way. For assistants like Jarvis to be able to control everything in homes for more people, we need more devices to be connected and the industry needs to develop common APIs and standards for the devices to talk to each other. Before we could build any AI, we first needed to write code to connect these systems, which all speak different languages and protocols. We use a Crestron system with our lights, thermostat and doors, a Sonos system with Spotify for music, a Samsung TV, and of course my work is connected to Facebook's systems. Further, most appliances aren't even connected to the internet yet. It's possible to control some of these using internet-connected power switches that let you turn the power on and off remotely. But often that isn't enough. For assistants like AIELON to be able to control everything in homes for more people, we need more devices to be connected and the industry needs to develop common APIs and standards for the devices to talk to each other. This can be achieved only by,

            <div class="container">
                <p align="justify">According to recent predictions within 5-10 years we'll have AI systems that are more accurate than people for each of our senses -- vision, hearing, touch, etc, as well as things like language. It's impressive how powerful the state of the art for these tools is becoming. At the same time, we are still far off from understanding how learning works. Everything we do this year -- natural language, face recognition, speech recognition and so on -- are all variants of the same fundamental pattern recognition techniques. We know how to show a computer many examples of something so it can recognize it accurately, but we still do not know how to take an idea from one domain and apply it to something completely different. To put that in perspective, We have a pretty good knowledge that can do lots of things. If WE spent 1,000 hours, we probably wouldn't be able to build a system that could learn completely new skills on its own -- unless we made some fundamental breakthrough in the state of AI along the way.
                    <br>In a way, AI is both closer and farther off than we imagine. AI is closer to being able to do more powerful things than most people expect -- driving cars, curing diseases, discovering planets, understanding media. Those will each have a great impact on the world, but we're still figuring out what real intelligence is. Overall, this was a great challenge. These challenges have a way of teaching me more than I expected at the beginning. This year I thought I'd learn about AI, and I also learned about home automation and Facebook's internal technology too. That's what's so interesting about these challenges. Thanks for following along with this challenge and I'm looking forward to sharing next year's challenge in a few weeks.
